# Bond-rtl_433 RF Sync

Corrects Bond Bridge's believed fan/light state from Ashby Park ceiling fan
wall-switch RF presses, without transmitting anything to the physical
devices — replaces an MQTT + Home-Assistant-automation pipeline with a
single self-contained add-on.

## Configuration

- `bond_host` / `bond_token` — Bond Bridge local API address and token.
- `rtl433_source` — `local` (USB dongle attached to this host, pick it in
  the Hardware tab) or `rtl_tcp` (point at a remote `rtl_tcp` server, e.g.
  a Raspberry Pi elsewhere on the network).
- `code_table` — maps each switch's decoded RF `stable_id` to a room/button.
- `room_devices` — maps each room to its Bond `device_id` and `max_speed`.
- `dry_run` — when true, logs the Bond call that would be made without
  sending it.

## Status

Under active development — see the project's implementation plan and design
spec in `docs/superpowers/`.
